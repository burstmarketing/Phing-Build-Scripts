2.1.7 - fixing problem with get_db,  does not create database properly if it doesn't exist
2.1.6 - make sure make_dir sets the config dir to 775 so apache can write to it
2.1.5 - small update to add useExisting to a few props so we can pass these in on update.code for
        the web interface
2.1.4 - add update.configs_and_db  wrapper to allow the development server to have one target call.
        multiple target calles from a seperate build process cause class redefinition conflicts in the custom_tasks
	target. (lame!)
2.1.3 - make sure site-configs folder is created.
2.1.2 - Add installation environment file to avoid doing a get_db on the same environment as the project

2.1.1 - Restructure directory so that: 
      		    config is unversioned and contains installation specific files and data  
		    project is versioned and contains project specific files and data
		    build should be files that are contained in external repo 

2.1.0 - Move custom tasks into ad-hock task defs in the lib/ folder. More portablility. 

2.0.2 - added project_environment.ini to .build dir to track vars that are project wide,  setting up to add an installation_envrionment.ini  to track installation specific variables. added GenDBConfigTask and GenEnvConfigTasks  to clean up slopy _loadProps and _loadEnvironment tasks (now removed). 

2.0.1 - loadFilesTask custom task added to make copy_configs target more readable.

2.0.0 - initial working version of build system,  includes update.db, update.configs, update.code and update.all
